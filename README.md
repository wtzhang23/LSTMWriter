# LSTMWriter
An implementation of an LSTM "natural language" generator. Not really that good (actually very bad), but was made just so I could have a template to copy and paste when needed.
## Dataset
I trained the model on the script for the Bee Movie.
## Results
See the out.txt file for some fun.
